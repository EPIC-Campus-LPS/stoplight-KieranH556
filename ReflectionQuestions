1. A python library adds additonal pre-made modules to code for further functionality, instead of having to make everything from nothing. Libaries can be added by using the "import" statement.
2. A series is where all of the components in the circut rely on each other to compelte the circut (One big circut). (I.e if the stoplight was a series, if the red light stops working, the rest of the stoplight stops working.)
   A parallel is where all of the individual components individyual rely on their own circuts (Ex: The lights each correspond to one power source each and they are individually controlled by those sources, not other components.)
